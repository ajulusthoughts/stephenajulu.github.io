I have always had a high level of enjoyment and excitment that comes from being able to solve problems and create new things. It is the main reason i started started this blog, to increase awareness, educate and help people learn more through his research and articles. You can visit the blog here: [ajulusthoughts.com](https://ajulusthoughts.wordpress.com). I am naturally curiuos and an introvert too.

I have founded/co-founded several companies i.e. OwlSec Technologies, Ajulu Technologies, Quevant e-Store, Alusa SS Investment among others.

I created my social media presence because 1) Iâ€™ve always had a passion for sharing knowledge and 2) the cybersecurity field is growing in demand faster than we can fill jobs.

My goal is to spread cybersecurity, ethical hacking, privacy and anonymity awareness and help grow our community in the process.

I am currently most interested in web applications, networks, cybersecurity, ethical hacking and technology in general.

During my free time, i enjoy reading, playing games, blogging, researching(i believe knowledge is power), fine tuning my skills, creating things(websites, logos, etc), watching movies(Genres: Sci-Fi, Tortured Genius, Cyberpunk among others)
