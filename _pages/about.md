Hello! My name is Stephen Ajulu. I live in Nairobi, Kenya.
I am a Front End Web Developer, Ethical Hacker, Researcher and Graphics/UI/UX Designer. I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology. I have always had a high level of enjoyment and excitment that comes from being able to solve problems, create new things and learn(I have an appetite for knowledge). It is the main reason i started started my blog back in 2016, to increase awareness, educate and help people learn through research. You can visit the blog here: [Ajulu's Thoughts](https://ajulusthoughts.wordpress.com). I am naturally curiuos and an INFJ or basically an Introvert.

I have founded/co-founded some companies i.e. OwlSec Technologies, Ajulu Technologies, Quevant e-Store, Alusa SS Investment among others.

I created my social media presence because i wanted to build my personal brand and also sharing knowledge.

My goal is to spread cybersecurity, ethical hacking, privacy and anonymity awareness and help grow our community in the process.

I am currently most interested in web applications, networks, cybersecurity, ethical hacking, android and technology in general.

During my free time, i enjoy reading, playing games, blogging, researching(i believe knowledge is power), fine tuning my skills, creating things(websites, logos, etc), watching movies(Genres: Sci-Fi, Tortured Genius, Cyberpunk among others)

# ABOUT THIS WEBSITE
This site is built on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), the theme i am using is [Kross](https://github.com/themefisher/kross-jekyll-portfolio-template) from [Themefisher](https://themefisher.com/). It is responsive and mobile friendly. I am hosting it on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for free. I am using [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com) as my Content Delivery Service, HTTPS servinng and for DOS protection. Icons are from [Themify](https://themify.me/themify-icons). Fonts are served through [Google Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts). This is my third website. Version 2 is here: . Version 1:.
I can help you build yours. I went with Jekyll instead of WordPress because:
- Jekyll is fast - It's a static site what does one expect. Thou i wish my site was faster. According to GTMetrics. My site's YSlow rating is 81% with a page load of 2.1s. Pagespeed rating however is 32%. But i will make improvements eventually.
- Jekyll is more affordable - Let's not pretend that you enjoy paying those 100 dollars for hosting. I honestly never encountered a good WordPress hosting service where it's price was below 70 dollars.
- Jekyll keeps me on my toes - Version 2 of my site had over 800 commits and it barely lasted 2 months. So 800 commits in 2 months. I have come to appreciate Liquid and markdown. The entire website is under my command! Bwahahaha! * evil laugh then evil theme song goes here* Basically i have full control. I can remove things and add things.
